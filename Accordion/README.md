# Simple Accordion Component
This component/snippet is a reusable accordion, where the content can be interchanged in each section and the whole thing can be resized by just changing the width of the "section-wrapper" class that contains the elements. Includes SVG sprite for the down arrows. JavaScript is only used for class toggling.
